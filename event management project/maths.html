    There should be a scope of learning beyond class room confinement to widen the knowledge of students and to provide exposure for real life problems relating to society. This is can be done by the establishemnt of Mathematics Clubs. A good teacher can involve his students in a number of co-curricular activities. Among them, mathematics club is also are to create interest and maintaining interest in mathematics using the structures be encouraged.. Certain activities like concept description by using models, understanding of problems with different views by using Mathematical softwares, discussions, lectures, certain mathematical games can be arranged. Overall this is the need of the hour to help students in having an idea of the practical utility of mathematics in addition to creating their interest in mathematics.

<h2>Objectives of Mathematics Club:</h2>

These clubsl pave the way for complete visualization and comprehension of mathematical concepts.
Mathematics club is the powerful tool to remove mathematics phobia among students.
Mathematics club helps in the proper utilization of leisure time.
It helps in arousing and maintaining studentsâ€™ interest in mathematics.
It provides the students with opportunities to develop their explorative, creative and inventive faculties.
It inculcates the habit of self-study and independent work among the students.
It offers an ideal avenue for a free exchange of mathematical ideas and for frank and helpful criticism of these ideas.
It provides an informal and a social atmosphere, which the classroom can hardly provide.
It offers excellent opportunities for free consideration of matters of special interest to the members without the necessity of following any particular sequence as required in a classroom.
It helps in developing heuristic and problem solving attitude among the students.
It provides opportunities for students to translate the theory into practice and to apply their learning in daily life situation
It helps the student to imbibe social qualities like co-operation, tolerance, adjustment and open-mindedness, as they work in groups.
It helps to meet individual needs of the students are every member gets an opportunity to work in his areas of interest.
